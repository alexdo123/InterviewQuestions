## Reasoning For Choosing Python
Python is really good at:

Working with JSON data

Doing quick math/logic transformations (like turning decimals into percentages or distributing values).

Producing structured output (JSON, text, or even writing new files).

It keeps things easy to modify later. If you need to change logic, itâ€™s just editing a few lines of Python instead of manually recalculating everything.

You can run the same scripts anytime with different input files, and Python will handle the formatting and math automatically.
