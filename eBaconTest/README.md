# eBacon Take-Home Project

## Overview
This project implements three coding exercises provided by eBacon:
1. Punch Logic Test – Calculate employee wages (regular, overtime, doubletime) and benefit totals based on time punches.
2. Benefit Logic Test – Allocate employee benefits (401K, HSA, FSA, etc.) from the benefit total and further distribute 401K contributions into investment accounts.
3. Dividend Logic Test – Distribute dividends for each investment proportionally to employees based on their holdings.
